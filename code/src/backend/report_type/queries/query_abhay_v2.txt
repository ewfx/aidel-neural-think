Act as a financial risk analyst and automate the research and evidence-gathering process for identifying, verifying, and risk-scoring entities from complex, multi-source transaction data. Analyze transaction data and provide detailed risk assessments for entities involved in these transactions. Your task is to extract entity names, classify them, assign risk scores, and provide supporting evidence for your assessments.

These are the input and output expectations : 
Input:
1.	Transaction Data Document: Document containing transaction details, including entity names.
2.	Public Data Sources: Utilize publicly available data from company registries, online sources, financial news, regulatory filings, and legal databases.
Output:
1. Detailed Report: Generate a structured output in JSON format containing extracted entities, classifications, risk scores, supporting evidence, and confidence scores for each transaction.
2. Classification Categories: Classify entities into categories such as corporations, non-profits, shell companies, government agencies, and individuals (especially PEPs).
3. Risk Scoring Criteria: Assign risk scores based on factors like entity reputation, sanctions status, transaction history, and network associations.
4. Anomaly Detection: Use statistical and machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in transactions.
5. Confidence Scores and Evidence: Calculate confidence scores based on the reliability of data sources and consistency of evidence. Include supporting evidence from news articles, regulatory filings, and other relevant sources.
